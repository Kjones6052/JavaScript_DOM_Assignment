# **Hello, World!**

The files in this repository are used for my assignment for JavaScript and the Document Object Model (DOM).


Overview:

For this assignment, I created an HTML web page and linked it to 3 JavaScript files to manipulate and style elements of the HTML web page. All tasks completed 
are notated prior to the code to indicate what objective is being completed by the code. An individual JavaScript file was created for each of the 3 parts of the 
assignment. Below is a list of all files included and a description of the file's contents.
